                                            <p>FirstSwim was an amazing experience for me as a parent of a very active toddler. I was slightly apprehensive due to my daughter Campbell's young age. She was 20 months old at the time, but I felt like it was important for her to take the class because Campbell was around water quite a bit. I have known Anna most of my life and I completely trusted her with my daughter.</p>
                                            <p>The classes were 30 minutes every day for a week. Parents are asked to drop their child off and leave. This was a concern at first until I saw how distracting it was for me to be there. Although Campbell cried every day, at the end of the week there was very little crying and she seemed happy in the water. Campbell learned to float on her back and to swim underwater to the side of the pool and hold on. On the last day, My husband and I got into the pool with Campbell and worked with her.  This was helpful so that we could continue practicing her skills after the class ended.</p>
                                            <p>It was hard to see how scared Campbell was and to leave a crying child, but in the end it was worth it. Anna was so gentle and loving with Campbell. Anna told her every day how special she was and what a great job she was doing.  Even when Campbell cried, Anna stayed calm and spoke to her in a very soothing voice.  One day I walked in to pick up Campbell and Anna had her floating on her back.  Campbell was very calm and Anna was singing, "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star." I knew at that moment signing Campbell up for the class had been the right decision. It was money well spent and I am signing her up for another class this spring.</p>

I was a little apprehensive because I didn't want my daughter to become fearful of water, because she loved it so much. But Anna has a way with children that makes them feel comfortable and helps them build confidence while learning to swim.</p>
                                            <p>Madelyn loves to swim and wants to show everyone!  After Madelyn's swim lessons with Anna, we had an experience where she feel in the pool while trying to grab a toy.  Madelyn immediately knew what to do after she fell in - she swam for the side of the pool calmly and pulled herself up.  It is so comforting to know that she has learned this important life skill.  First swim with Anna is highly recommended.  Thank you Anna!</p>

                                            <p>When our five-year-old daughter, Maggie, began her week of swim lessons with Anna, she had a tremendous fear of going underwater. She’d taken lessons at the YMCA before, and we hadn’t seen much progress. When Anna told us her students would be swimming unassisted by the fourth lesson, my husband and I thought she might need to revise her claims and issue a disclaimer after working with our daughter.</p>
                                            <p>Amazingly, Anna helped her overcome her fears by the third day. There were certainly tears when we dropped her off that morning, but Maggie was beaming when we came to pick her up. She was so proud to show us that she could really and truly swim, with her face in the water! We couldn’t believe Anna could work that magic in just a few 30-minute lessons.</p>
                                            <p>Anna is incredibly gentle and encouraging, yet firm in pushing her students to achieve their realistic swimming milestones. Her smiles and kindness went a long way to helping Maggie, as did the fun prizes she gave after each lesson. Maggie was thrilled with her “big prize” and ribbon that Anna gave her on the last day. We loved seeing her joy at accomplishing a goal in her life and the confidence it’s given her in other areas to try until she succeeds. We’re so thankful for Anna and the breakthrough she enabled for Maggie in just a week!</p>

                        <article>
                            <dl>
                                <dt>How long is the lesson program?</dt>
                                <dd>Each session is 30 minutes, for five consecutive days, Monday through Friday.</dd>

                                <dt>What ages does FirstSwim work with?</dt>
                                <dd>Children that are 2+ years old.</dd>

                                <dt>Can I stay and watch during a lesson?</dt>
                                <dd>Parents are asked not to be seen by the children for the first few days of lessons, but they are more than welcome to watch from a spot that the child can not see them. Also, for the Friday lesson parents are encouraged to get in the pool with the instructor and child to learn how to continue working the skills that were taught.</dd>
                      
                                <dt>What happens in the event of a weather cancellation?</dt>
                                <dd>If one day is missed, the lesson can be made up at a different time. However, if more than one is missed the rest of the week's lessons are cancelled and we'll have to schedule in the child for a different week.</dd>

                                <dt>How is FirstSwim different than other types of infant or toddler swimming lessons?</dt>
                                <dd>Safety and prevention is always the top priority for children in and around the pool. FirstSwim goes beyond just accident prevention and works to build a child's confidence in the water so they can have fun and become strong swimmers. Combining awareness, confidence, and skills helps prepare children to react to accidents in a calm and practiced way, and let's everyone enjoy the water with more peace of mind.
